<a class=anchor href=#join-us-at-carpentryconnect-manchester-2019>#</a></h3><p>Did you see the recent announcement, that registration is now open for the CarpentryConnect Manchester conference? The event is an opportunity for members of The Carpentries’ global community of instructors and anyone else with an interest in helping researchers to improve their computational skills, to get together for a few days to exchange ideas and learn some new things. With an exciting programme (still under development, no spoilers!) including sessions focussing on developing new and existing curricula, increasing the sustainability of research software, methods and tools for better teaching, and more, the conference will have as much to offer those who are newcomers to The Carpentries as it does to those who have attended a workshop, helped or taught at one or two, or been involved for years.</p><p>Still not sure what to expect? Following the success of the inaugural CarpentryCon in Dublin last summer, several of the attendees wrote about their experiences describing some of the workshops and breakouts, reflecting on their experiences, and generally celebrating the chance to bring such a diverse and dispersed community together
(<a href=https://carpentries.org/blog/2018/06/carpentry-con-report/%29>https://carpentries.org/blog/2018/06/carpentry-con-report/)</a>.
The organising taskforce of CarpentryConnect Manchester, chaired by Aleks Nenadic and including several organisers of the event in 2018, has every intention of creating a sister event with a similar atmosphere of creativity, inclusivity and optimism, and a love of using sticky notes for almost everything.</p><p>We hope that the structure of the programme (<a href=https://software.ac.uk/ccmcr19/programme>https://software.ac.uk/ccmcr19/programme</a>), with bursts of lightning talks to spark conversation, long breaks to create space for deeper discussion and networking, and an emphasis on workshops, tutorials and breakout sessions, reflects the importance placed on community building and professional development that I have been so inspired by at previous events of both the Research Software Engineers and Carpentries. The conference offers a chance to learn about and discuss the latest developments and challenges in computational teaching and research software development, to access training in relevant skills, tools, and resources, and to get to know other members of this warm and welcoming community. For more detail on the programme, keep an eye out as we announcement our keynote speakers over the coming weeks.</p><p>We’d love to see plenty of new faces at the conference, as well as bringing together as many
Instructors, Trainers, Mentors, and Maintainers, as possible from the UK, Europe, and across the world. So, if any of the above sounds interesting to you, we’d love for you to go ahead and register. If you do so before 18 April 2019, you’ll be able to take advantage of the Early Bird discount.</p><p><strong>We look forward to seeing you in Manchester in June!</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Level</strong>: beginner to intermediate</li><li><strong>When</strong>: 25th June 2019 - 27th June 2019</li><li><strong>Time</strong>: 9:00-19:00</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: The Studio Manchester on 25th and 26th of June and in the Kilburn Building at the School of Computer Science (University of Manchester) on 27th June</li><li><strong>More information and registration</strong>: <a href=https://software.ac.uk/ccmcr19/programme>https://software.ac.uk/ccmcr19/programme</a></li></ul></p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"><div><a class="flex align-center" href=https://github.com/uio-carpentry/uio-carpentry.github.io/edit/master/content/study_group/activities/2019-06-25-CarpentryConnect.md target=_blank rel=noopener><img src=/svg/edit.svg class=book-icon alt=Edit>
