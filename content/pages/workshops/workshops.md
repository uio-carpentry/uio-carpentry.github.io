# Workshops

We organize workshops multiple times a year. The best place to learn more about our workshops or register for one of them is [the University of Oslo Library's Carpentry course catalogue](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/courses-events/courses/other/Carpentry/). Inbetween workshops we meet for study groups. To learn more about the study group go [here](https://uio-carpentry.github.io/studyGroup/).
