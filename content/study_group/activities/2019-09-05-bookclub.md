**Session leader**: Annika Rockenberger

**Topic**: Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing

We are reading the article "Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing" by Greg Wilson et al.

[https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510)

Come and discuss the article with us!

We want to create a Carpentries-style, half-day workshop based on the article, to be piloted in the fall semester here at UiO.
Please bring the text & your laptop: we will work together brainstorming how to develop a lesson based on the contents of the article,
and start creating a repository for the workshop development using the Carpentries [lesson template](https://github.com/carpentries/styles).
