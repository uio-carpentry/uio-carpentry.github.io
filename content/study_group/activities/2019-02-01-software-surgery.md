**Session leader**: Anne Fouilloux

This is a drop-in session for asking specific problems on Python programming.

Come with your specific problem:

- you are stuck with your program and do not understand why it does not work
- you are unsure about which python package to use for solving a specific problem
- you have tried to use a Python package but it does not work as you expected.

or come and help:

- you are willing to share your knowledge of Python and help other to better use it

**It is not a tutorial and does not aim to provide general Python programming training.**

_This is a knowledge sharing session and if you come with a problem you understand that we do our best to help but there is no guarantee on the outcome of the session._

**When**: 1st February 2019, 14-16h
