# Julefest
 
The temperatures have already dropped below 0Â°C and friends and colleagues have started booking their annual end-of-the-year-travels.
Which means it is about time to prepare for a decent Julefest with the Carpentry@UiO community!
 
I hereby invite you all to a low key get-together, accompanied by spiced tea, cocoa, gingerbread, and other seasonally appropriate edibles.
 
## When?
December 12, from 4pm onwards
 
## Where?               
University of Oslo, Blindern Campus, Niels Henrik Abels hus, Room 209
(= the teaching room adjacent to the Science Fiction section of the Science Library)
 
## What to bring? 
Yourself! You may bring a laptop. You may also contribute to the edibles ðŸ˜Š
 
## Do I need to sign up?     
You donâ€™t have to, but we would appreciate knowing how many Carpenters to expect so we can buy tea etc. accordingly.
Please send an email to annika [.] rockenberger [@] ub [.] uio [.] no.
 

We are looking forward to seeing you!
