**Session leader**: Dmytro Perepolkin and Øystein Sørensen

Sometimes R code just isn’t fast enough. You’ve used profiling to figure out where your bottlenecks are, and you’ve done everything you can in R, but your code still isn’t fast enough. In this talk you will learn how you can improve performance by rewriting key functions in C++. Rcpp provides a clean, approachable API that lets you write high-performance code with as little friction as possible.
