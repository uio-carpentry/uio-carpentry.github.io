**What's happening?**

Due to Covid-19 spreading and closed buildings of UiO and unknown level of interest, the session is canceled. It will be held in future, either online or in person, when the situation gets better and there is enough interest.

We meet and together create a website using Jekyll. We will learn a bit about web design and web development.

Come with your laptop â€“ it's best if you have Jekyll already installed and running on your machine (Mac Users: this might be an advanced process. Google is your friend here).
