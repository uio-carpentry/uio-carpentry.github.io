**Session leader**: Radovan Bast, Anne Fouilloux and Sabry Razick.

### Course goals

The aim of this course is to demonstrate to and familiarize the workshop participants with best practices and tools in modern research software development. The main focus is on professional tools for efficiently developing and maintaining research software. Since most research code is developed in a collaborative setting, we will discuss tools and workflows which facilitate this process. Most of the content is also relevant to a single developer.

### Who the course is for

If you are writing code that is used in research, then this course is for you. If you develop research code and you know all the tools already, join us as a helper! It's fun, and you always learn something new about a subject by teaching it.
