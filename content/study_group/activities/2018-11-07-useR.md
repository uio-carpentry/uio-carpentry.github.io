**Session leader**: Raoul Wolf

Raoul will share his experience from simplifying a workflow by writing an R package; under the restriction of minimal dependencies, while maintaining full compatibility for tidyverse. In his own words: «I was working on a new project and I noticed I was sourcing dozens of functions from multiple scripts. I thought to myself: “I might as well do what everyone is doing and write a package!» Come and join us in learning how to identify the need for a package, strategically plan the process of writing the package, and to keep track on applicability and usability.
