At the kick-off event, we'll get to know each other, exchange our interests into either using some new technology like IoT, micro-electornics, or looking for interesting application and challenging settings for these technology. The goal is to come together and establish few key projects on which we can learn and collaborate across our own disciplines. 

- When: Tuesday 18 September, 14-18h:
	- 14-16h flash presentations (8 min)
