### What we'll do

R has advanced capabilities for managing spatial data and it provides unparalleled opportunities for managing, visualizing and analyzing such data.

In this meetup we will learn about R packages `{sf}` and `{stars}`, commonly used for manipulating feature and gridded data. The meetup will also include a brief introduction to the associated underlying theory, such as projections, DE-9IM, and spectral indices, as well as applied examples.

### Packages
- `{sf}` and `{stars}`
