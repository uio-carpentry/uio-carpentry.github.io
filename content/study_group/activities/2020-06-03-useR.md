### What we'll do

When working with data, we often want to create models to predict future events, but we also want an even deeper understanding of how our data is connected or structured. In this workshop, we will explore the connectedness of data using using structural equation modeling (SEM) with {lavaan} package.

Stay tuned for updates!
