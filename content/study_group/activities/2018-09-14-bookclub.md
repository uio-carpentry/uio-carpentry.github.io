We do not meet this week but we encourage you start reading and commenting Greg Wilson's book "Teaching Tech together". 

We are using [https://web.hypothes.is/](https://web.hypothes.is/), an online tool to annotate the web, with anyone, anywhere.

Start reading "Teaching Tech together" using hypothes.is at [https://hypothes.is/groups/mReaNk2e/studygroup-uio](https://hypothes.is/groups/mReaNk2e/studygroup-uio).
