**Session leader**: Annika Rockenberger

**Topic**: Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing

Picking up from where we left on [5th September 2019](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/studyGroup/blob/gh-pages/_posts/2019-09-05-bookclub.markdown), 
we continue developing a lesson for a half-day workshop based on the article by 
Wilson et al. "Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing" (2017).
The article focuses not so much on computing but general digital literacy and good routines.

Join if you are interested in lesson development, digital literacy, and how to improve our daily data and computational habits!

It's recommended to have read the article by Wilson et al. [https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510).
