**Session leader**: Annika Rockenberger

During this session, we will look at a couple of examples of personal websites of researchers and other academics. We will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of hosting your own website, of having a website at your research institution or university or using commercial platforms like LinkedIn, ResearchGate, Academia.edu etc. We will also look at alternatives, e.g. creating a professional profile website hosted on GitHub.

The event is open for anyone! Please bring a laptop or other smart device.
