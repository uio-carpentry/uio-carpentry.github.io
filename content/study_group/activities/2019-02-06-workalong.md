**Session leader:** Annika Rockenberger

A short work along trying out alternatives to git bash, especially for Windows users.

Bring your laptop. We want to look at editors like Atom, oXygen XML editor, Sublime and others which have git plugins. The goal is to come up with a handy guide on how to make use of git (on Windows) without having to install and run Git Bash, especially if the user doesn't have admin rights. We can publish the guide and give it out to our workshop participants at UiO-Carpentry workshops.

We meet in the Foyer of the National Library at Solli plass.

**When:** 6th February 2019

**Time:** 14:00-16:00

**Location:** National Library of Norway, Henrik Ibsens gate 110, 0254 Oslo, Room "Slottsbibliotek"
