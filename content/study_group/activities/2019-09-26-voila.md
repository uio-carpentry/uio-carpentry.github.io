Rendering of live Jupyter notebooks with interactive widgets.

**Voila** serves live Jupyter notebook including Jupyter interactive widgets.

Unlike the usual HTML-converted notebooks, each user connecting to the Voila tornado application gets a dedicated Jupyter kernel which can execute the callbacks to changes in Jupyter interactive widgets.

During this two hour session, we plan to explore the **voila** package and learn how to use it. The idea is to understand if it is useful for our researchers.

We will go through existing **voila** examples and learn to use it ourselves.
