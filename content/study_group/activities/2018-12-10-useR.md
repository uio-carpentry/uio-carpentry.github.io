**Session leader**: Toju Idowu and Dmytro Perepolkin

In this talk, I will show you how I’ve used `R` to delve deep into how football works. I’ll work through a simple GLM using some of the new tidymodels packages.

About the speaker:
Toju is an actuary originally from the UK, living in Oslo. He has been using `R` for about four years ever since he accidentally discovered it while searching for how to do linear regression in Excel. Now he use `R` for almost everything data related both at work and at home on side projects.
