Come and meet us for two hours to learn about Internet of Things and work 
with an Arduino (demos).
Annika will bring a couple of Arduino Unos, breadboards, jumper cables, LEDs, resistors, buttons and a selection of sensors (light, distance, temperature, CO2 sensors). We have a take on physical programming with Arduino and micro electronics. It will be fun!
