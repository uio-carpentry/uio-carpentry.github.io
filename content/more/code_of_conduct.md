# Code of Conduct

We follow the [Carpentries' Code of
Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/policies/coc/)
to provide an inclusive and supportive environment for our learners and
our members. Any violation of our Code of Conduct should be reported, it
will then be handled as quickly as possible and will remain
confidential:

- to report Code of Conduct violations for official Carpentries
    workshops, see the Carpentries [Code of Conduct Incident Reporting
    Guidelines](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/incident-reporting.html)
- to report Code of Conduct violations for local Carpentry@UiO
    workshops, use UiO's
    [speak-up](https://www.uio.no/english/about/hse/speak-up/index.html)
    (English) or [si-fra](https://www.uio.no/om/hms/si-fra/) (Norwegian)
    reporting

If the workshop is a local workshop rather than an official Carpentries
workshop, the workshop website will have the Carpentry@UiO logo:
