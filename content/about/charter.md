election.

Responsibilities of each officer of the board are as follows:

    as necessary

- Receive all communication from UiO to the board and relay as
    necessary

### Vice-Chair

    perform these duties in the chair's absence
- Ensure that any board members who have been given tasks know what it
    is they have been asked to do
- Check that action has been taken following decisions at previous
    meetings

### Secretary

    board EC meetings
- Revise minutes for publication
- Report decisions and action items in formal minutes published
    publicly (when applicable)

### Communications officer

## Elections

Elections will be held at the start of each fall semester. The board
chair and board secretary are in charge of organizing annual election
for board renewal.

Candidates will self nominate with a short (<300 words) statement that
will be publicly posted for voters to review.

The criteria for individuals to stand for election to the board are:

- Has participated in a Carpentries event in any capacity (learner,
    helper, instructor, organizer, or host) at UiO or elsewhere in the
    past 2 years

Anyone who has participated in a Carpentries event in any capacity
(learner, helper, instructor, organizer, or host) at UiO or elsewhere in
the past 2 years will be eligible to vote. An election manager will be
identified by the board to maintain the eligible voter list, notify
voters, and tally votes.

The board will select the two candidates who received the largest number
of votes to constitute the newly elected members of the next board. In
case of ties, the board may use any method to choose among tied
candidates to ensure that no more than two candidates are selected to
constitute the newly elected members of the next board.

## Amendments to the Charter

Amendments to the charter can be proposed by existing board members in
writing in advance of any board meeting.

Amendments require a 2/3 majority vote to be accepted.
