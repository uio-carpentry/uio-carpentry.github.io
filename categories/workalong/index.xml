Level: beginner When: Thursday, May 14 Time: 16:00-18:00 Location: Niels Henrik Abels hus Room 209 What&amp;rsquo;s happening?
We meet and together we explore a couple of add-ons, plugins and extensions for Zotero. If you know a cool add-on, please bring it and show us how to use it!
Come with your laptop – it&amp;rsquo;s probably a good idea to have Zotero installed.</description></item><item><title>&lt;Canceled> Workalong - Creating Websites with Jekyll</title><link>https:uio-carpentry.github.io/study_group/activities/2020-04-02-workalong/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https:uio-carpentry.github.io/study_group/activities/2020-04-02-workalong/</guid><description>Session leader: Naoe Tatara

Due to Covid-19 spreading and closed buildings of UiO and unknown level of interest, the session is canceled. It will be held in future, either online or in person, when the situation gets better and there is enough interest.
We meet and together create a website using Jekyll. We will learn a bit about web design and web development.</description></item></channel></rss>
