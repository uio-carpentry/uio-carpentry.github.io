We are a group of volunteers from the University of Oslo and beyond. With support from the University of Oslo Library, we offer to PhD students, researchers and others at UiO, and beyond:
foundational coding and data science skills workshops from Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Study Group events dedicated to open and reproducible science, knowledge sharing, re-enforcing learning or discussing new subjects for future workshops/lesson development educational development and networking opportunities with the possibility to become Certified Carpentries Instructor and/or Carpentries Instructor Trainer Our activities and community are open to any member of the UiO community including staff, faculty, and students, paid, and volunteer. We believe the Carpentries&rsquo; teaching methods are efficient and can speed up take-up toward the adoption of Open Science at UiO.
What do we do? # Our primary activity is organizing and teaching hands-on foundational coding and data science skills workshops using the materials and practices of the Data and Software Carpentry organizations. The club will also provide educational development and networking opportunities for instructors. To maintain transparency, board meeting notes, workshop schedules, and all other club activities will be posted publicly on the web (when possible) at the Carpentries@UiO website.
Contributing # Carpentry@UiO is open to anyone interested in teaching foundational coding and data science skills outside of the traditional UiO curriculum. All our members abide to the Carpentry@UiO code of conduct.

The structured, step-by-step approach and the availability of immediate assistance were highlighted as major strengths. The workshops were also commended for their suitable pace and starting from the basics.
However, attendees suggested improvements such as more information on applications, spreading the content over three days for a better pace, higher-level workshops, and more comprehensive material coverage. A pre-session for technical setup and slower pacing in certain sections were also recommended.
Instructors and helpers were praised for their effective problem-solving support and clear explanations, especially for non-intuitive coding aspects. While the workshops were well-received for their beginner-friendly approach, there was a desire for advanced content and better preparatory resources.
Fall semester workshops # Participants really liked the hands-on approach and how easy it was to learn different tasks, especially in bash and Python. They appreciated the interactive sessions, the immediate help available, and the encouragement to ask questions.
However, they suggested some improvements: including more advanced topics, making the learning environment more comfortable, adding more challenging tasks, and extending the workshop duration to cover the material more thoroughly, especially for beginners. Overall, the feedback was very positive, with strong support for continuing these courses.

TO DO FOR 2024 NOTES # When sending the post-workshop survey send also link to DSC newsletter
Continue to open the courses for a number greater than the actual capacity, this helps to prevent low turn-out even when people deregister.
When sending out reminder emails (1 week before workshop) add that there is a waitlist, asking people to please deregister if they do not intend on attending, this also helps to prevent low turn-out.
Course information needs to be made more visible for the participants in the site and sending an e-mail with set-up instructions in advance
Make a recurrent social event for the community (once a month)
The Board should host information meetings of some form for new Carpentry@UiO members
Email Templates (all can be found in the Teams Carpentry@UiO folder): # Continue to send a reminder email to registered participants one-week before the workshop.
Continue to send a reminder email to registered participants with the pre-workshop survey 2 days before the workshop.
Continue to send a post-workshop email to registered participants immediately after the workshop, including the post-workshop survey link.

We did this mainly due to &ldquo;feedback fatigue&rdquo; which we experienced during 2019 already. Since we are now registering all official Carpentries workshops and official free-standing Carpentries modules with the Carpentries&rsquo; database AMY, we have access to their pre- and post-workshop surveys.
At the same time, we set a general reflection around workshop evaluations in motion with the wish to re-phrase and shorten workshop feedback forms. This work is still ongoing. Plans are to create a new feedback form in 2022. ? #* have something been done with this?
In the meantime, &ldquo;sticky-note feedback&rdquo; is occasionally collected at on-site workshops. This is mainly used for workshop de-briefing with instructors and helpers. The transcribed feedback is kept in a secure cloud storage space and can be accessed upon request.
General themes of all modes of feedback that we received during and after workshops are:
Requests # learners request (more) advanced workshops for the same tools, especially R and Python learners request more frequent workshops learners request more a workshop on Ggplot2 package in R Appreciation # learners appreciate the availability and fast response of helpers learners like the &ldquo;friendly atmosphere&rdquo; of Carpentries workshops learners mostly appreciate the slow pace and the focus on participatory live coding Social events # An online onboarding session (September) ? Carpentry@UiO community fika (October) ? Carpentry@UiO yule brunch (December) Organisation # Local Community Coordinator # The tasks of the local community coordinator were shared by AR and NT (both University of Oslo Library). In practice, this means support in recruiting instructors and helpers for workshops, setting up workshop websites, setting up and managing workshop registration, communication with workshop participants, communication with The Carpentries regarding workshops, maintenance of the UiO-Carpentry websites hosted by UiO/UBO as well as the community website hosted on GitHub, managing mailing lists, communication with the UiO-community via mailing lists, booking rooms and/or setting up virtual rooms, checking in with instructors and helpers before and after workshops.
The local coordinators established and documented effective routines for most tasks regarding hosting workshops and community-communication.

Learner Feedback and Continuous Evaluation # Carpentries survey # In this year, we used the Carpentries pre- and post-workshop survey. Due to the problems described in the next section, we have not yet gotten access to the whole dataset. However, the responses given in 5-Likert scale were mostly positive.
On the other hand, the responses written in free text are summarised in &ldquo;Carpentries-survey-results&rdquo; Sheet in Carpentry@UiO G Suite shared drive, which is accessible only to board members. If the contents are deemed to be non-person identifiable, this can be archived in GitHub repository in .tsv format.
Major strength # Among the 47 responses (in total for all the workshops) on major strength of the workshop, the following is found as commonly expressed.
Access to helpers and responsive instructors Learners appreciated that their problems were quickly solved by the helpers and instructors. Easy to follow and understand Clear instructions from basics, good pace, access to written lesson materials are much appreciated. Good lesson materials and hands-on style Practical exercises with realistic examples well mixed with lectures were raised as a solid strength. What to be improved # From the 36 free-text responses (in total for all the workshops) on something to be improved, the following are found to be major issues.
Time allocation For example, a suggestion for two days instead of one day, felt the pace is faster in the latter part compared to the time spent on the basic parts in the morning. Preparation Both for learners and instructors. Lack of preparation should not drain others&rsquo; (regardless of the role) time. Clearer description of the workshop contents and prerequisites These are expressed in terms of the level of the workshops and the skills that were necessary for the workshop (such as the use of the command-line interface). How instructors and helpers affected learning experiences # Most of the 36 free-text responses (in total for all the workshops) on how instructors and helpers affected learning experiences, were about quick and flexible help on troubles learners got.
Other minor opinions include themes relevant to the preparation mentioned above. In online workshops, effective use of helpers was raised as a factor that affects learning experiences on both positive and negative side.
Survey in future # Using the Carpentries survey was found to have some drawbacks.
Low response rate The response rates, especially for the post-workshop survey, were generally low (mostly less than half). Limited access to results When the number of responses is less than 10, the system does not allow downloading result data but only show the summary. Naoe has requested the core team to gather all the responses to the surveys for UiO workshops in 2020, but the data is not yet available. Not fully applicable/relevant questions Beside the questions asked are not necessarily very relevant to each workshop, as the workshop by Carpentry@UiO mostly focuses on single-lesson rather than the two-day standard workshops. The Board on the 9th Dec discussed and decided to continue using the Carpentries survey. Instructor onboarding manual is to be edited to make sure that the instructors keep the last 5 minutes for completing the post-workshop survey. (Link to board meeting Minutes: https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/meetings/201209_board_meeting.md)
Also, some fundamental questions that the Library is interested in will be implemented in the sign-up form.
Workshops # UiO-Carpentry arranged altogether 11 one-day Software Carpentry workshops (most of which could be taught on-site) and was part of two two-day Data Carpentry workshops and two half-day mini-workshops (conducted online). During spring/summer and late fall Software Carpentry workshops were moved online, while several workshops in early fall could be arranged on-site with reduced participant numbers.
For the 11 Carpentry workshops arranged by UiO-Carpentry, in total, 492 sign-ups were made. Total capacity was 283, and the number of learners who attended was in total 187. Due to even more limited access to rooms in addition to the reduced capacity of each room at UiO, the in-person workshop capacity in the Autumn semester was reduced to approximately 1/3 of that of Spring semester before covid-19 related restrictions applied.
One-day workshops # January Writing and Publishing Together on the Web Using GitHub - on-site January Plotting and Programming with Python - on-site January R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis - on-site February The Bash Shell - on-site February Python (intermediate) - on-site February Version Control with Git - on-site May Version Control with Git - Online - online September The Unix Shell - on-site September Version Control with Git - on-site October R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis - on-site November Databases and SQL - online Two-day workshops # Two Data Carpentry online workshops arranged by Nord University were open for external participants from Norway.

Community Building &amp; Social Events # COVID-19 posed a challenge in regards to community building and arranging social events for UiO-Carpentry. With moving many activities online and good communication with our members, we managed to organise a fair number of social events and community activities.
Onboarding # Three onboarding sessions were held, two on-site sessions in January 2020 and one online session in September 2020. Onboarding is intended for new instructors and helpers and as a general information exchange around the practicalities of running Carpentry workshops at UiO. Materials for the onboarding events are updated continuously and can be accessed on GitHub, UiO-Carpentry/organisational/workshop_operations
StudyGroup # 4 StudyGroup meetings were held between January and early March 2020. Moving the StudyGroup online seemed like a good solution. Still, participation dwindled towards summer (3 meetings were held), likely as a result of overexposure to online meetings, conferences, and workshops etc. The StudyGroup was thus put on halt during the fall.
Recruiting # Four new instructors (with a focus on R) could be recruited for UiO-Carpentry, another instructor is in training. Two seats came out of the NeiC CodeRefinery Platinum Membership (UiO members were eligible due to UiO&rsquo;s membership in NeiC). Besides, an already certified instructor recently joined UiO. Several new helpers could be recruited and supported workshops, both on-site and online during 2020.
The Carpentries record shows that eight seats were used in the membership year of May 2019 to May 2020, which exceeds the reserved spots by 2. On the 8th Dec 2020, it is however shown that UiO has six seats remaining for the membership period of August 2020 to August 2021. Naoe made an inquiry regarding the number of seats reserved for UiO during the current membership period to the core team and is still waiting for confirmation.
Update on the 17th Dec. It is confirmed that in the previous membership year UiO had 3 unused seats carried over from years before. 1 seat remained unused, but this is not to be carried over to this (2020 Aug - 2021 Aug) membership year. Thus, we have 6 seats for 2020 Aug - 2021 Aug.
Actively recruiting candidates from the UiO-Carpentry community for these spots had to be postponed to 2021. Several potential instructors declined the offer due to lack of time. More active recruitment has to be initiated in early 2021.
Social Events # Two social events for the UiO-Carpentry community were arranged online, one at the end of summer and one before Christmas 2020. They were held online.

Workshop page # Where: https://www.ub.uio.no/english/courses-events/courses/other/Carpentry/ Focus: Descriptions of typical lessons covered and format of the workshops. Structure: Having a sub-directory that contains files that are about each workshop (called &ldquo;arrangement files&rdquo;). Community page # Where: https://www.ub.uio.no/english/writing-publishing/dsc/carpentry-uio/index.html Focus: Introduction of Carpentry@UiO as a community. Structure: Currently a single page under DSC&rsquo;s site. Giving info about who we are, what we are doing, and how to get involved, as well as an explanation of the Carpentries. GitHub, Communication # All official documentation of workshops and other activities of UiO-Carpentry is published under the UiO-Carpentry GitHub organisation. The GitHub repositories are actively maintained by the community, the Board, and the local coordinators. Apart from repositories for workshop websites, UiO-Carpentry maintains the following community repositories:
governance (community statutes, code of conduct, procedures) organisational (reports, onboarding documents, how-tos) studygroup (StudyGroup website and events) uio-carpentry.github.io (previous workshop and calendar) A significant change was made to communications: the domain for the UiO-Carpentry mailing lists was changed from @swcarpentry to @carpentry. Also, one underused mailing list was discarded (resbaz).
The community now actively uses the following mailing lists:
carpadmin @ carpentry dot uio dot no &ndash;&gt; coordinators at the University Library and the chairperson of the Carpentry@UiO Board organisers @ carpentry dot uio dot no &ndash;&gt; all instructors and helpers, plus those on the carpadmin list announcements @ carpentry dot uio dot no &ndash;&gt; all people that have shown interest or have attended workshops + those on the organisers list contact-us @ carpentry dot uio dot no&ndash;&gt; coordinators at the University Library. To be used for workshop communications board @ carpentry dot uio dot no&ndash;&gt; the members of the Carpentry@UiO Board All lists have been updated.
The subscribers of the organisers list have been contacted and asked for re-subscription. There are now 41 active members on the list of previously &gt;80 of unclear status.
Via the list, instructors and helpers for workshops are recruited, and information relevant to the UiO-Carpentry community is communicated.

The responses are collected in Nettskjema. For this report, I have downloaded the data from the main Nettkjema survey as well as the data from two survey forms that were created for the GitHub workshop in September 2019 and the Databases and SQL workshop in October 2019. The questions in all survey forms were identical.
After downloading the survey data (tabular data) as an Excel spreadsheet, I have combined the data from all three spreadsheets into one single spreadsheet. Due to the nature of some of the questions, the values in the columns &ldquo;Professional Role&rdquo; and &ldquo;Institutional Affiliation&rdquo; vary greatly. I have normalised the values for both columns manually. I.e. the different spelling variations of &ldquo;University of Oslo&rdquo; have been normalised to &ldquo;UiO&rdquo;, while all departmental affiliations were omitted, since they were not stated in more than 50% of responses. For the values in &ldquo;Professional Role&rdquo; I have looked at the free text option for &ldquo;Other&rdquo; and normalised the responses to either fit the pre-set values (e.g. &ldquo;researcher&rdquo;, &ldquo;PhD&rdquo;, &ldquo;PostDoc&rdquo;) or made the role more explicit (e.g. &ldquo;database administrator&rdquo;).
For the simple analyses, I have used the Pivot-table function in MS Excel and created bar charts.
The original data (anonymised) is stored on a UiO G-Suite directory and can be accessed upon request.

Utilisation # We had booked rooms for 34 full-day workshops, we held 13 workshops and two on-boarding sessions (both on the same day).
Feedback From Our Learners # We got feedback for 10 workshops from 103 participants.
Who Are Our Learners? # Which Institutions Are Our Learners Affiliated With? # Are We Reaching Our Goals With Software Carpentry? # Would You Recommend This Workshop To A Friend Or Colleague? # Have You, After The Course, Used What You Learned? # Was This Workshop Worth My Time? # How Much Practical Knowledge Did You Gain From The Workshop? # Should We Have Other And More Workshops at UiO? - What Workshop or Topics Are Our Learners Missing? # Most participants&rsquo; request that we offer more - and different - workshops.
The main request is for courses that built on the Python and R for novices workshops.
There is a strong need expressed for more advanced R, especially in combination with statistical methods. This is perhaps something that other units at UiO, e.g. USIT, as well as the individual departments can address.
Some participants ask for more workshops for Unix Shell / Bash and Git.
There are more requests for machine learning workshops.
In addition, participants request workshops for research data management, workflow management, unit tests, data preparation and cleaning, information security, GitHub, Internet of Things (IoT), programming with Fortran and Julia, and GIS.
There is a significant amount of participants requesting data visualisation workshops.
At this point, it is difficult for the Carpentry@UiO community to meet the requests that go beyond the lessons that The Carpentries offer, e.g. statistics, machine learning, other programming languages than Python and R, information security, IoT etc. Perhaps, some of these requests could be met by CodeRefinery workshops (e.g. the &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; versions of Carpentry lessons). Another course of action could be to share the more specific requests of some participants with USIT which has resources to offer tailored workshops and courses beyond Carpentry. Tapping into our Carpentry@UiO members&rsquo; knowledge and expertise might, in addition, prove useful in developing new workshops - or episodes to existing workshops - that meet our participants&rsquo; needs.
As a general take-away for the workshop planning for spring 2020 should not only the number of workshops on Python and R for novices be increased, but also complementary workshops on both Python and R be offered to our learners. This issue has been considered in the workshop planning.
Comments and Constructive Criticism # Comments usually are generous and positive feedback. Some participants point out the lack of enough helpers, or comment on speed, previous knowledge, level of the workshop etc. A more frequent comment is that people get stuck and fall behind - and do not ask the helpers or instructors. This should be anticipated and accommodated for with more – and shorter – breaks. Another issue is the delay in the beginning of some workshops. This has been reduced significantly (anecdotal evidence) by explicitly stating in the course description on the uio.no course catalogue that participants need to come prepared in order to participate.

Introduction # Data Collection # An online survey was created using Nettskjema (University of Oslo web-tool for surveys). The questions asked can be found in the survey document. The survey was then send to the organizers mailing list on Oct 10. A reminder to participate in the survey was sent out to the same list on Oct 16 and Nov 06. On Nov 07, 20 submissions were registered. Assuming that of the 68 subscribers to the mailing list at least 5 are staff support, the participation in the survey was ca. 1/3.
Due to confidentiality reasons, the data this report is based on cannot be published. It is accessible for members of the Board via the University of Oslo G-Suite. The data will be deleted no later than Nov 7, 2024.
Overall Impression # Overall, the people who responded to the survey are known local instructors, with a few exceptions. Of the 12 people who participated in the instructor training in summer 2019, 4 submitted their answers to the survey.
Critique # Even though the survey was mainly targeted at instructors, it was open for helpers, too. It was, however, not designed to capture the helper-function properly. This is a flaw. Based on the comments received in the survey, at least two people have been active as helpers and not as instructors.
Are you a certified Carpentries-instructor? # Yes No 13 7 11 Oslo-based Carpentries Instructors on Carpentries website, cross-check revealed ca. 50% overlap.
How many times per year are you willing to teach or co-teach a Carpentries workshop at UiO? # Number of instructors Teachings per year 13 2 6 3-5 2 1 1* &gt;5 *(as helper)
Which lesson(s) are you comfortable teaching or co-teaching? # Software Carpentry # Our staple lessons are Unix Shell, Git, and Python; a good amount of instructors are versed in R, too. We have far less people feeling comfortable teaching SQL and Make.
Data Carpentry # Significantly less people feel they can teach Data Carpentry. 2 indicated they could teach the Ecology lesson, 3 the Genomics lesson and 2 were comfortable teaching Geospatial Data.
However, 9 indicated they could teach a Carpentries-inspired GitHub lesson.
Support from local UiO-Carpentry community # Everyone except 2 responded that they feel they get enough support from UiO-Carpentry. The two which responded negatively were asked for feedback (in the form) and answered that they didn&rsquo;t ask for support or that since they are a helper they didn&rsquo;t feel it applied to them.
Workshop organisation and support # Asked whether they feel they know who to set up a workshop website and run a workshop at UiO, 16 answered in the affirmative.
4 stated they did not feel they know how to do those things. Their explanations were that they either didn&rsquo;t mind since they could ask for information when needed, that they felt they needed to try it out to get used to it or that the question didn&rsquo;t apply to them since they were helpers, not instructors.
Registration via AMY, Carpentries instructor database # 11 stated they were registered. The list of people doesn&rsquo;t match the information publicly available on Carpentries.org (however, Carpentries.org states that not all information is shown and that there might be a lag. It is ultimately up to the individual instructor to keep their profile up to date).
9 stated they aren&rsquo;t instructors, with at least some indicating that they would like to become instructors or are in the process of checking-out.
Anything you would like to let us know # Ca. half of the participants left a comment. Mostly indicating their willingness to teach (more) and explanations for why they haven&rsquo;t contributed as much as they would have wanted.

Topic: Preparing something cool for the Carpentries Tagathon in Week 44
Hackathon - Tagathon # The Carpentries are inviting to a community initative in week 44 called &ldquo;Hacktoberfest&rdquo;. It is about tagging the many blog posts on the three Carpentries websites: Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and Library Carpentry. The aim is to make the posts more findable by assigning topics.
Combining the skills taught in The Carpentries with the power of Digital Humanities, this StudyGroup will attempt to create a set of tags for the blog posts based on computational text analysis. How does one read 1 million blog posts? Not at all! A machine can do this much better (and faster)!
We will use pandoc to convert the blog posts written in markdown to a format that the online topic explorer VoyantTools can ingest and see what it reveals about the content of the blogs. We will then take a look at the tag set that the Carpentries has prepared and compare the two. The Final product could be a semi-automatic tagger based on text analysis.
In order to participate, you don&rsquo;t need to know any of the software and tools we are going to use. You should, however, bring your laptop and your curiosity and enthusiasm to experiment!

The Carpentry@UiO community is alive and well – a new team of coordinators from the University Library together with the Interim Board are working hard to support you in teaching workshops in the Carpentries spirit.
In order to gain a better and more up-to-date overview of who we are as a community, the Interim Board and the University Library have created a short survey about the status quo of our instructors.
If you are a certified The Carpentries instructor (Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry) and you are located in the Oslo area, we kindly ask you to take 5 minutes to answer our survey.
Your contribution will make sure that the Carpentry@UiO community thrives!
Confidentiality # Your responses will be collected in Nettskjema and exported as an .xlsx file to be then shared on UiO&rsquo;s G-Suite platform with the members of the Interim and later Elected Board and the Carpentry@UiO coordinators at the University of Oslo Library. We will keep your responses for no longer than five years after which they will be deleted. We do not intend to publish any of the responses.
Risks and Benefits # There are no direct risks or benefits to you from filling out this survey and no compensation. We hope to use these results to improve how we run the community and Carpentries workshops.
Consent # You are not required to take this survey. You may quit the survey at any time or skip any item other than those required to correctly sort your responses.
Questions # Your name (first name and surname)? What is your e-mail address? Are you a certified The Carpentries Instructor? Y / N Certified means that you have successfully completed the Carpentries Instructor training. The training consists of a two-day workshop and three complementary exercises that must be finished within 90 days after the workshop. When did you last teach or co-teach a Carpentries workshop at UiO? Please paste in the workshop URL (you can look it up on the Carpentry@UiO workshop log on GitHub). If you cannot find your workshop there, please fill in the year and month instead. How many times per year are you willing to teach or co-teach a Carpentries workshop at UiO? You can contribute to a workshop in many ways. As a lead instructor who is responsible for the lesson selection and layout, but also as a co-instructor, where you can teach anything from entire episodes to small chunks of an episode.

Rendering of live Jupyter notebooks with interactive widgets.
Voila serves live Jupyter notebook including Jupyter interactive widgets.
Unlike the usual HTML-converted notebooks, each user connecting to the Voila tornado application gets a dedicated Jupyter kernel which can execute the callbacks to changes in Jupyter interactive widgets.
During this two hour session, we plan to explore the voila package and learn how to use it. The idea is to understand if it is useful for our researchers.
We will go through existing voila examples and learn to use it ourselves.

Topic: Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing
Picking up from where we left on 5th September 2019, we continue developing a lesson for a half-day workshop based on the article by Wilson et al. &ldquo;Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing&rdquo; (2017). The article focuses not so much on computing but general digital literacy and good routines.
Join if you are interested in lesson development, digital literacy, and how to improve our daily data and computational habits!

Utilization # We had booked rooms for 19 full-day workshops, we held 9 workshops.
Feedback From Our Learners # We got feedback for 6 workshops.
Who Are Our Learners? # The Majority of our learners are Phds - and researchers on various levels. We have a few students, mainly on masters&rsquo; level, and a couple of engineers with various backgrounds.
There seems to be confusion about what to choose as &ldquo;role&rdquo;; perhaps we could add an explanation to the Nettskjema or add more fields to choose from?
Which Institutions Are Our Learners Affiliated With? # The vast majority is from UiO. A few learners are from other universities: OsloMet (1) and NMBU (5). Some are from the University Hospital (3), the Veterinarian Institute (1), The Institute of Cancer Research (1) NIVA (3), Noroff (1) and TØI (1). The individual departments are rarely mentioned.
A third of those filling out the Nettskjema did not write their institutional affiliation: Why? &ndash; There seems to be confusion around what we are asking for here, and perhaps: Why we want to know their affiliation in the first place.
What Workshop or Topics Are Our Learners Missing? # Summing up from the surveys, most learners are interested in learning any or more of Python and R. Most want to use it for data analysis, thus requesting focus on packages like Pandas, NumPy, SciPy etc.
They also want more targeted courses on specific kinds of data (e.g. ecology, climate, bio, archeology, spatio-temporal).
Generally, learners ask to learn more about statistics or want to do more practical statistical analysis with R or Python.
Additionally, plotting and visualization are requested.
Indepented from language, many learners asked for workshops dealing with data preparation and data cleaning - basically everything that happens before analysis.
Machine learning is more and more requested.
Generally, there is a need for more workshops on advanced levels. Learners who aren&rsquo;t novices anymore don&rsquo;t seem to find workshops for their level; this might also be a reason for why our workshops often have quite advanced learners even though they are explicitely targeted towards novices &ndash; an issue that occasionally leads to overbooked workshops and dissatisfied learners and teachers.
There is also the request for workshops for specific tools, like SPSS. USIT has courses; we could consider spreading information about these at our workshops.
Summing up: Including more Data Carpentry workshops could help meet the learners&rsquo;s needs.
Comments and Constructive Criticism # Generally, our learners really appreciate that we offer workshops on a variety of topics and rate the workshops overall very positively. Our instructors are highly regarded for their enthusiasm, teaching spirit and patience and the helper-system gets univocally positive feedback. Positives are: Helpers and individual assistance &ndash; enthusiastic teachers &ndash; pedagogic teaching &ndash; good atmosphere &ndash; real life examples (data, code)
There is a certain amount of criticism, not all of which is directed at our workshop organisation and instructores. Generally, communication before the workshop could be improved. Prior to the workshops, clearer instructions on installation of software, download of data sets or code bits and ** quick self-tests are recommended. Apart from that, learners would like to get a more realistic schedule for the the workshop: will the topics mentioned in the schedule actually be taught in the workshop. (Comment AR: We have experienced that we are note able to teach the entire Python module in one day; of 10 lessons we manage 6; the course description has the entire 10 lessons, thus creating expectations we cannot meet). Time management and workshop logistics have been mentioned as an area of improvement, especially when it comes to breaks. Overall, our instructors and helpers receive very positive feedback. However, live coding and navigation speed is sometimes an issue as are too short or missing explanations. Most criticism is directed at co-learners who arrive unprepared which leads to delays and occupies helpers and instructors Are We Reaching Our Goals With Software Carpentry? # YES. We reach them fully &ndash; or at least somewhat.
Should We Have Other And More Workshops at UiO? # Overwhelmingly YES.
Would You Recommend This Workshop To A Friend Or Colleague? # Overwhelmingly, learners strongly agree or agree that they would recommend our workshops. Only a tiny number is either neutral, or disagrees.
Have You, After The Course, Used What You Learned? # Half answered that they haven&rsquo;t yet used what they&rsquo;ve learned but might in the future, while roughly a third answered that they have used some of it. A little less than a quarter of learners said they&rsquo;ve used most or all of it. Only one person had not used anything at all.
Was This Workshop Worth My Time? # Overwhelmingly, learners answered that they strongly agreed or agreed that the workshop was worth their time. A few were neutral as to whether it was worth their time, while 3 disagreed or strongly disagreed.
How Much Practical Knowledge Did You Gain From The Workshop? # Much more than half of the learners answered that they learned a great deal, while roughly a third answered that they gained some practical knowledge. One answered that they gained none.

The event is an opportunity for members of The Carpentries’ global community of instructors and anyone else with an interest in helping researchers to improve their computational skills, to get together for a few days to exchange ideas and learn some new things. With an exciting programme (still under development, no spoilers!) including sessions focussing on developing new and existing curricula, increasing the sustainability of research software, methods and tools for better teaching, and more, the conference will have as much to offer those who are newcomers to The Carpentries as it does to those who have attended a workshop, helped or taught at one or two, or been involved for years.
Still not sure what to expect? Following the success of the inaugural CarpentryCon in Dublin last summer, several of the attendees wrote about their experiences describing some of the workshops and breakouts, reflecting on their experiences, and generally celebrating the chance to bring such a diverse and dispersed community together (https://carpentries.org/blog/2018/06/carpentry-con-report/). The organising taskforce of CarpentryConnect Manchester, chaired by Aleks Nenadic and including several organisers of the event in 2018, has every intention of creating a sister event with a similar atmosphere of creativity, inclusivity and optimism, and a love of using sticky notes for almost everything.
We hope that the structure of the programme (https://software.ac.uk/ccmcr19/programme), with bursts of lightning talks to spark conversation, long breaks to create space for deeper discussion and networking, and an emphasis on workshops, tutorials and breakout sessions, reflects the importance placed on community building and professional development that I have been so inspired by at previous events of both the Research Software Engineers and Carpentries. The conference offers a chance to learn about and discuss the latest developments and challenges in computational teaching and research software development, to access training in relevant skills, tools, and resources, and to get to know other members of this warm and welcoming community. For more detail on the programme, keep an eye out as we announcement our keynote speakers over the coming weeks.
We’d love to see plenty of new faces at the conference, as well as bringing together as many Instructors, Trainers, Mentors, and Maintainers, as possible from the UK, Europe, and across the world. So, if any of the above sounds interesting to you, we’d love for you to go ahead and register. If you do so before 18 April 2019, you’ll be able to take advantage of the Early Bird discount.

Group, Workshop Straightforward introduction to mixed models",section:"Study Group Activities",content:`Session leader: Dmytro P. and Athanasia Monika M.
In this workshop we will be exploring how to use linear mixed models when we have data that repeats over time. These kinds of models are often used in longitudinal studies or with time series data. They are powerful as the used maximum likelihood approximations rather than least squares, meaning they can better handle missing data, and competing models can be compared directly. By the end of the workshop you should have a basic grasp of the linear mixed model, how to specify one, how to compare models and how to plot results.
This workshop expects participants to have intermediate proficiency in R and is not fully suitable for beginners. The instructor may not have time to thoroughly explain code that is not directly related to mixed models, so if you have little or no experience with R, I think it will be tough to follow as a workshop.
About the speaker The workshop is held by Athanasia Monika Mowinckel, or Mo for short, who is a staff scientist at the Center for Lifespan changes in brain and cognition (LCBC: www.oslobrains.no).

Bayesian methods for rank and preference data - from recommendation systems to cancer genomics
Ranking items is crucial for collecting information about preferences in many areas, from marketing to politics. The interest often lies both in producing estimates of the consensus ranking of the items, which is shared among users, and in learning individualized preferences of the users, useful for providing personalized recommendations. In the latter task it is particularly relevant to have posterior distributions of individual rankings, since these can provide an evaluation of the uncertainty associated to the estimates, and thus they can avoid unnecessarily spamming the users.
I will present a statistical model which works well in these situations, and which is able of flexibly handling quite different kind of data. The Bayesian paradigm allows a fully probabilistic analysis, and it easily handles missing data and cluster estimation via augmentation procedures. Interestingly, this Bayesian framework has also proved to be useful for genomic data integration, since typically heterogeneous microarray data are available from different sources, and their combination allows both to gain statistical power and to strengthen the biological insight.
Valeria Vitelli holds a PhD in statistics from Politecnico di Milano, Italy. She was a postdoc at Ecole Centrale Paris for a year, within a research group funded by Eléctricité de France working on big data problems in the energy sector. She then moved to the University of Oslo, where after a 5 years postdoc period funded from the Norwegian Cancer Society she became associate professor in September 2018. Her experience spans over several areas of mathematics and statistics, including functional data analysis with applications in physiology, machine learning (describing people mobility in dense urbanized areas from mobile phone data), and finally statistical genomics of cancer.

Choosing best model for your machine learning problem may be daunting task. H2O AutoML simplifies the process of setting up the complex machine learning modeling pipelines to just a few lines of code. You will learn how to make your own stacked ensemble in the first 30 min of the workshop. For those who want to stick around for the rest of the evening, we will go a bit deeper into specification of individual models (GLM, GBM, Neural Networks, etc) and understanding of model performance.
After attending this workshop, learners will be able to set up their own machine learning pipeline in R from simple data preparation to specification of the classification or regression model, training, evaluation of the model using validation set, and prediction on the test data. Users will be also introduced to the concepts of ensembles and stacking and will be able to specify and run automatic machine learning models, analyze and pick best models and use them for predicting the outcomes.

“Visualization can surprise, but it doesn’t scale. Modeling scales well, but it can’t fundamentally surprise.” – Hadley Wickham.
One of the most important phases in the Data Analysis process is data visualization. It is an inherently human activity which relies on our ability to comprehend visual information and make sense of patterns. However, there’s only so much we can spend in visualizing the data, and regardless how many hours we may decide to put into it, it is never going to be enough. Therefore, it is important to be able to build simple custom-purposed visualizations that facilitate sense-making and can trigger new ideas for modelling.
This project has started as a small-scale proof of concept for using {htmlwidgets} in R markdown. But then, inspired by awesome talk by Matt Dray (@mattdray) at #EARL2018, it took new direction incorporating new interactive features and data filtering. In this talk Kristijan will walk you through the process of thinking through, composing and deploying interactive Rmarkdown reports without help of Shiny server, using DT, leaflet, mapview, plotly, crosstalk and flexdashboard.
About the speaker:
Kristijan, originally from Croatia, has a master’s degree in Geology of Mineral Resources and Geophysical Exploration. He has been working as an exploration geologist in the field of oil and gas exploration for almost five years. Majority of the time he spent on the other end of the data analysis tunnel – in the realm of specialized commercial front-ends. There he visualized, analyzed and interpreted the data, within the given software boundaries and with a different hat; completely unaware of what was happening with the data in the background.
In 2017 he started working in a hybrid data analyst role, and approximately six months ago, mainly in his free time, he started with a new hobby - learning about a toolbox called R and its wealth of packages. After so many years working “indirectly” with the data, R started to empower him to understand the data analysis process. He likes to summarize his R journey so far as mindset changing and simply fun. Main sources he is using for learning R are friendly colleagues (Dmytro), google, https://www.datacamp.com/ and books from https://bookdown.org/).

The next RLadies-Oslo next meetup is set for December 3rd, with the amazing @ZazzValette presenting &ldquo;Topic modelling - what is it, and how does VG use it?”
Topic models (TM) are powerful tools to programmatically uncover textual structure in what otherwise appear to be just plain unstructured text. The applications of TM are many, like content analysis, article search, and personalisation of content. Isabelle Valette will take us through what topic models are, the way the algorithm works, and how VG has been using it inside and outside the newsroom.
Who is Isabelle? French data nerd, nature lover and week-end hiker, Isabelle works as a data scientist at the media house VG, one of Norway&rsquo;s largest newspaper.

Founded in 1998, it runs short, intensive workshops that cover program design, version control, testing, and task automation.
In 2015, the (then) only two certified Software Carpentry instructors, Karin Lagesen and Lex Nederbragt, started a collaboration with the Science Library (Realfagsbilbioteket), with the goal to offer more workshops and recruit more instructors.
This document is a summary of our activities in 2015 and our thoughts of continuing the effort in 2016.
Activities in 2015 # We have offered three workshops to UiO and OUS staff, in February, June and December 101 PhDs, Postdocs, master students and other staff registered for these workshops We taught in total 70 participants Registrants came from Geosciences, Biosciences (IBV), Medical Genetics, Oslo University Hospital, Astrophysics, Pharmacy, Mathematics, the Natural History Museum, Chemistry, the Science Library (Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences) and the Department of Literature, Area Studies and European Languages (Faculty of Humanities) We went from two certified, volunteer instructors to four And additional five people took the Software Carpentry instructor training and are close to becoming certified Three more persons have helped at workshops and shown interest to become instructors we started using email lists organizers@swcarpentry.uio.no for the instructors and helpers announce@swcarpentry.uio.no for announcements of new workshops and other events discussions@swcarpentry.uio.no for discussing amongst past participants and instructors/helpers Workshops were organised with the following program:
day 1, morning, task automation with unix day 1, afternoon, version control with git and github day 2, introduction to python and modular program design The interest for these workshops demonstrates that there is a clear need for the type of training Software Carpentry offers. Many researchers will need to analyse, or write tools to analyse, larger and larger datasets, but lack the formal training to do this effectively. Software Carpentry addresses this gap as a grassroots organisation, taught by researchers for researchers.
The help of the Science Library has been very important, they book rooms, arrange registration (both sign-up before the workshop, and at the beginning of the workshops) and generally make it very easy for the instructors to fully focus on the teaching itself.
Outlook for 2016 # Given the interest in 2015, we foresee a significant growth and expansion of the Software Carpentry effort in 2016.
In 2016, we expect to:
Offer at least 6 workshops Add modules on the R programming language Participate in the planned ‘Carpentry week’ around the Science Library birthday celebrations in March, with multiple workshops, round table-discussions etc.; we have already a confirmation from Data Carpentry that their Executive Director will visit Oslo to participate that week Start offering Intermediate level workshops with more advanced version control, scientific python etc (for this we need to train instructors or invite experienced volunteer instructors and refund them their travel and lodging) Start offering Data Carpentry workshops. Data Carpentry’s mission (http://www.datacarpentry.org) is to provide researchers high-quality, domain-specific training covering the full lifecycle of data-driven research with a focus on computational skills needed for data management and analysis in all domains of research At least double the number of certified instructors and the number of helpers Have at least four certified Data Carpentry instructors One of our goals is to convince the University of Oslo to become an Software Carpentry Foundation Affiliate. Such a status is a prerequisite for having prioritised access to instructor training (for which there is overwhelming interest). Affiliate status has relatively few requirements/costs for UiO, while there are several benefits. Details can be found at http://software-carpentry.org/scf/membership.html.

Workshop evaluation # In 2020, the community managers together with the library and the Board decided to stop with sending out post-workshop evaluations. We did this mainly due to &ldquo;feedback fatigue&rdquo; which we experienced during 2019 already. Since we are now registering all official Carpentries workshops and official free-standing Carpentries modules with the Carpentries&rsquo; database AMY, we have access to their pre- and post-workshop surveys.
At the same time, we set a general reflection around workshop evaluations in motion with the wish to re-phrase and shorten workshop feedback forms. This work is still ongoing. Plans are to create a new feedback form in 2022.
In the meantime, &ldquo;sticky-note feedback&rdquo; is occasionally collected at on-site workshops. This is mainly used for workshop de-briefing with instructors and helpers. The transcribed feedback is kept in a secure cloud storage space and can be accessed upon request.
General themes of all modes of feedback that we received during and after workshops are:
Requests # learners request (more) advanced workshops for the same tools, especially R and Python learners request more frequent workshops learners request workshop for other tools, like Matlab, SPSS, etc. learners request either online - or on-site workshops Appreciation # learners appreciate the availability of helpers learners like the &ldquo;atmosphere&rdquo; of Carpentries workshops learners appreciate the slow pace and the focus on participatory live coding Social events # An online onboarding session (September) Carpentry@UiO community fika (October) Carpentry@UiO yule brunch (December) New instructors # Period Aug 2020 - Aug 2021 # Six spots were available with the Aug 2020 - Aug 2021 membership.

The website now has all information relevant to the community in one place and can be found here: https://uio-carpentry.github.io/. Documentation for the website is available here: https://github.com/uio-carpentry/uio-carpentry.github.io#readme.
In addition, the Carpentry@UiO information pages hosted at the University of Oslo library have been restructured and underwent a general and customized re-design process. Community member and former board member Naoe Tatara has led the customized re-design process and the restructuring. The main website with information about Carpentry@UiO at the University of Oslo library can be accessed here: https://www.ub.uio.no/english/writing-publishing/dsc/carpentry-uio/. The library publishes all workshops and free-standing Carpentries modules in the Digital Scholarship Center&rsquo;s course catalogue for Carpentries workshops: https://www.ub.uio.no/english/courses-events/courses/other/Carpentry/.
Information about Carpentry@UiO activities and community is now concentrated on two sites, where one is maintained by the community (GitHub) and the other maintained by the University of Oslo Library (DSC)
Outreach # Community manager and board member Annika Rockenberger initiated an outreach action to address fluctuations in the community during Covid-19 and as a general measure of promoting Carpentries activities at the University of Oslo library, UiO and beyond. The community manager announces workshops via the DSC&rsquo;s course catalogue, mailing lists (announcements and digital humanities) at UiO, and Twitter. The library designed and ordered two beach flags with the Carpentry@UiO logo to be put up alongside workshops and community events for increased on-site visibility. In addition, the library designed and ordered 100 coffee mugs with the Carpentry@UiO logo and is planning to hand them out to instructors, helpers, and other supporters of the community. We also designed 500 vinyl stickers (laptop stickers) that we distribute at workshops and among the community for branding and visibility.
Carpentry @ UB # The University of Oslo library is a silver member of the Carpentries, also for 2021.
Preparations for a briefing about Carpentry@UiO (community and workshop activities) for the library&rsquo;s leadership team and the University of Oslo&rsquo;s Fagråd for eInfrastruktur are underway with presentations in Jan 2022 and Dec 2021, respectively.
Currently, the Carpentry@UiO community is managed by Annika Rockenberger (Humanities and Social Sciences Library) and Aino Rinhaug (Digital Scholarship Center).

Carpentry administration (Carp Admin): carpadmin@carpentry.uio.no Carpentry organizers mailing list: organizers@carpentry.uio.no Carpentry announcements mailing list: announcements@carpentry.uio.no. Carpentry contact-us: contact-us@carpentry.uio.no Prerequisites:
Read the Carpentries Code of Conduct Create a GitHub profile and ask Carp Admin to invite you as a member of UiO-Carpentry What do you want to do? # To be completed in order # 1. Choose a lesson
You can teach any of the lessons from the Carpentries curriculum, including the core lessons from Software, Data, and/or Library Carpentry. Alternatively, if you have developed lesson material you can contact Carp Admin and suggest a workshop. 2. Answer the call/ reach out
Several times per semester, we send out calls to the community, reply to the call if you are interested. You can also contact the local or regional coordinator and propose a workshop by sending an email to Carp Admin. 3. Find co-instructors and helpers
Ask the community via the Carpentry organizers mailing list, or attend our bi-annual event where we plan the semester. Tip: ask for new helpers via the Carpentry announcements mailing list. 4. Familiarize yourself with the General guidelines
The Carpentries Handbook The Carpentries Code of Conduct Instructor Checklist Tips For Instructors 5. Plan out the following with the help of your co-instructor(s):
Decide which episodes and exercises (minimum and extra) to cover. Delegate teaching for episodes and exercises. Create a timeline for the day, be sure to allot time for set-up, introduction (inc. explanation of Carpentries Code of Conduct), breaks, closing remarks and the post-workshop survey/ feedback. Preferred date(s) 6. Share the above information with your helpers and Carp Admin
7. Edit the workshop website on GitHub
Once you have shared the above information, Carp Admin will set up a workshop repository in the UiO-Carpentry Git Hub page. You must edit the necessary parts by following the README.md &ldquo;Customizing Your Website&rdquo;, and the website will be created automatically. When the contents are in place, send a notification to Carp Admin. Before teaching
Check the results of the pre-workshop survey to understand your learners. Try out the projector, check the network, etc., to ensure technical parts work as planned (if not, or if any equipment is needed, contact Carp Admin). During teaching
Explain the Carpentries Code of Conduct at the beginning of the workshop. Do a short security briefing at the beginning of the workshop. Explain the sticky notes system During teaching
Ask the participants to answer the post-workshop survey at the end of the workshop, as well as feedback using the sticky notes provided in the equipment box (collect these). Promote other Carpentry@UiO workshops as well as UiO’s Digital Scholarship Centre (DSC) After teaching
Right after the workshop, do a feedback round with your co-instructors and helpers, using the sticky note feedback as guidance. If workshop participants ask for a Certificate of Attendance after the workshop ask them to email the Contact-us email address. Before workshop
Participate in administrative communication prior to the workshop. Get in contact with the co-instructors and familiarize yourself with the teaching materials and exercises. It is often during the start of the workshop and during workshop exercises that helpers are needed most. Prior to the workshop pick-up the Carpentries equipment box, which is located in the University of Oslo’s HumSam library 2nd floor offices (contact Carp Admin) During workshop
As the helper you are in charge of the sticky notes. Be attentive: look actively for sticky notes coming up – and if participants look lost during lessons. If you see that a lot of sticky notes come up or that many participants get lost, gently interrupt the co-instructor so that all participants can catch up. Before lunch break, pass around sticky notes for a mid-day feedback round, so instructors can make any needed adjustments for the group. After workshop
Do another round of stick note feedback that can be used in an immediate post-workshop feedback round with instructors and helpers. Leave the seminar room clean and orderly; make sure that no equipment is left, windows are closed, and lights are off. A few days after the workshop, one of the helpers must write a summary of the feedback and general impressions from the workshop and send these to the co-instructors and other helpers (tip: keep the sticky notes from the feedback rounds to use for information). Before workshop
Booking of suitable rooms for workshops. Determining capacity and any room information necessary to collect for running the workshop smoothly. Create UiO event page for the workshop using Vortex, that appears under &ldquo;upcoming workshops&rdquo; of UiO Library &gt; Digital Scholarship Centre’s (DSC) freestanding course catalogue in English. Preparing a sign-up form linked from the event page shown on the event page and administration of this sign-up form. By default, we close registration two days before the workshop date. Automatic reminders for workshop participants are sent out via the registration system one week and again three days before the workshop. The registration system can handle any additional information that instructors want to send participants. Setting up a workshop website repository in the uio-carpentry GitHub account and sharing the link with instructors so they can fill it in. When the contents are in place, the administrator will link the workshop website to the event page on the UiO Library&rsquo;s course catalogue. Publishing, promotion, and dissemination of the workshop on UBOslo Twitter, DSC’s webpage, DSC’s monthly newsletter, and sending an announcement email to the Carpentry announcements mailing list about the workshop. Submission of self-organized workshop registration form to Carpentry.org using the following information, so that instructors will receive links to pre- and post-workshop surveys and the results.
