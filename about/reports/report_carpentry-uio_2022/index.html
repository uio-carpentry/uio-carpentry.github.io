<a class=anchor href=#workshops>#</a></h2><p>UiO-Carpentry arranged altogether 11 one-day Software Carpentry workshops (most of which could be taught on-site) and was part of two two-day Data Carpentry workshops and two half-day mini-workshops (conducted online). During spring/summer and late fall Software Carpentry workshops were moved online, while several workshops in early fall could be arranged on-site with reduced participant numbers.</p><p>For the 11 Carpentry workshops arranged by UiO-Carpentry, in total, 492 sign-ups were made. Total capacity was 283, and the number of learners who attended was in total 187. Due to even more limited access to rooms in addition to the reduced capacity of each room at UiO, the in-person workshop capacity in the Autumn semester was reduced to approximately 1/3 of that of Spring semester before covid-19 related restrictions applied.</p><h3 id=one-day-workshops>One-day workshops

<a class=anchor href=#community-building--social-events>#</a></h2><p>COVID-19 posed a challenge in regards to community building and arranging social events for UiO-Carpentry. With moving many activities online and good communication with our members, we managed to organise a fair number of social events and community activities.</p><h3 id=onboarding>Onboarding
<a class=anchor href=#onboarding>#</a></h3><p>Three onboarding sessions were held, two on-site sessions in January 2020 and one online session in September 2020. Onboarding is intended for new instructors and helpers and as a general information exchange around the practicalities of running Carpentry workshops at UiO. Materials for the onboarding events are updated continuously and can be accessed on GitHub, <a href=https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/tree/master/workshop_operations>UiO-Carpentry/organisational/workshop_operations</a></p><h3 id=studygroup>StudyGroup
<a class=anchor href=#studygroup>#</a></h3><p>4 StudyGroup meetings were held between January and early March 2020. Moving the StudyGroup online seemed like a good solution. Still, participation dwindled towards summer (3 meetings were held), likely as a result of overexposure to online meetings, conferences, and workshops etc. The StudyGroup was thus put on halt during the fall.</p><h3 id=recruiting>Recruiting
<a class=anchor href=#recruiting>#</a></h3><p>Four new instructors (with a focus on R) could be recruited for UiO-Carpentry, another instructor is in training. Two seats came out of the NeiC CodeRefinery Platinum Membership (UiO members were eligible due to UiO&rsquo;s membership in NeiC). Besides, an already certified instructor recently joined UiO. Several new helpers could be recruited and supported workshops, both on-site and online during 2020.</p><p>The Carpentries record shows that eight seats were used in the membership year of May 2019 to May 2020, which exceeds the reserved spots by 2. On the 8th Dec 2020, it is however shown that UiO has six seats remaining for the membership period of August 2020 to August 2021. Naoe made an inquiry regarding the number of seats reserved for UiO during the current membership period to the core team and is still waiting for confirmation.</p><p><em>Update on the 17th Dec.</em>
It is confirmed that in the previous membership year UiO had 3 unused seats carried over from years before. 1 seat remained unused, but this is not to be carried over to this (2020 Aug - 2021 Aug) membership year. Thus, we have 6 seats for 2020 Aug - 2021 Aug.</p><p>Actively recruiting candidates from the UiO-Carpentry community for these spots had to be postponed to 2021. Several potential instructors declined the offer due to lack of time. More active recruitment has to be initiated in early 2021.</p><h3 id=social-events>Social Events

<a class=anchor href=#local-community-coordinator>#</a></h3><p>The tasks of the local community coordinator were shared by AR and NT (both University of Oslo Library). In practice, this means support in recruiting instructors and helpers for workshops, setting up workshop websites, setting up and managing workshop registration, communication with workshop participants, communication with The Carpentries regarding workshops, maintenance of the UiO-Carpentry websites hosted by UiO/UBO as well as the community website hosted on GitHub, managing mailing lists, communication with the UiO-community via mailing lists, booking rooms and/or setting up virtual rooms, checking in with instructors and helpers before and after workshops.</p><p>The local coordinators established and documented effective routines for most tasks regarding hosting workshops and community-communication.</p><h3 id=board>Board
<a class=anchor href=#board>#</a></h3><p>In March 2020, the UiO-Carpentry Board was successfully constituted. The election took place in February, and four Board Members were elected for a term of 2 years. In addition, the UiO library appointed two Board Members. The Board consists of the following members:</p><ul><li><strong>Chair</strong> Lex Nederbragt</li><li><strong>Vice-chair</strong> Viviane Girardin</li><li><strong>Communication officer</strong> Naoe Tatara (appointed by UiO library)</li><li><strong>Secretary</strong> Tobias Busch</li><li>Annika Rockenberger (appointed by UiO library)</li><li>Anne Bergsaker</li></ul><p>The Board can be contacted via Board @ carpentry dot uio dot no. The Board had four meetings during 2020, minutes for the meetings can be found in (organisational/meetings), &ldquo;yyddmm_board-meeting.md&rdquo;.</p><h3 id=website>Website
