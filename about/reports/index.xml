The Carpentry@UiO community is alive and well – a new team of coordinators from the University Library together with the Interim Board are working hard to support you in teaching workshops in the Carpentries spirit.
In order to gain a better and more up-to-date overview of who we are as a community, the Interim Board and the University Library have created a short survey about the status quo of our instructors.</description></item><item><title>Carpentries-Workshops Spring 2019 -- Summary Of Learners' Feedback</title><link>https:uio-carpentry.github.io/about/reports/summary_feedback_carpentries_spring_2019/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https:uio-carpentry.github.io/about/reports/summary_feedback_carpentries_spring_2019/</guid><description>Carpentries-Workshops Spring 2019 &amp;ndash; Summary Of Learners' Feedback # Workshops # Workshops We Taught # Python (novices) - Feb 8, 2019 Intro to Git (novices) - Feb 15, 2019 Git in Practice (intermediate) - Feb 27, 2019 Data Analysis and Visualisation in R for Ecologists - Mar 8, 2019 Unix Shell (novices) - Apr 24, 2019 Data Analysis and Visualisation in R for Ecologists - May 15, 2019 Introduction to R with Tidyverse (pt.</description></item><item><title>Software Carpentry at the University of Oslo in 2015 and 2016</title><link>https:uio-carpentry.github.io/about/reports/report_2015/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https:uio-carpentry.github.io/about/reports/report_2015/</guid><description>Software Carpentry at the University of Oslo in 2015 and 2016 # Software Carpentry is a volunteer organization whose goal is to make scientists more productive, and their work more reliable, by teaching them basic computing skills. Founded in 1998, it runs short, intensive workshops that cover program design, version control, testing, and task automation.
In 2015, the (then) only two certified Software Carpentry instructors, Karin Lagesen and Lex Nederbragt, started a collaboration with the Science Library (Realfagsbilbioteket), with the goal to offer more workshops and recruit more instructors.</description></item></channel></rss>
