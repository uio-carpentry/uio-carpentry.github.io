<a class=anchor href=#feedback-from-our-learners>#</a></h2><p>We got feedback for 6 workshops.</p><h3 id=who-are-our-learners>Who Are Our Learners?
<a class=anchor href=#who-are-our-learners>#</a></h3><p>The Majority of our learners are Phds - and researchers on various levels.
We have a few students, mainly on masters' level, and a couple of engineers with various backgrounds.</p><p><img src=https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/reporting/images/carpentry_report_2019_01_chart_role_learner.png alt="Who are our learners - academic background"></p><p><em>There seems to be confusion about what to choose as &ldquo;role&rdquo;; perhaps we could add an explanation to the Nettskjema or add more fields to choose from?</em></p><h3 id=which-institutions-are-our-learners-affiliated-with>Which Institutions Are Our Learners Affiliated With?
<a class=anchor href=#which-institutions-are-our-learners-affiliated-with>#</a></h3><p>The vast majority is from UiO. A few learners are from other universities: OsloMet (1) and NMBU (5).
Some are from the University Hospital (3), the Veterinarian Institute (1), The Institute of Cancer Research (1) NIVA (3), Noroff (1) and TÃ˜I (1).
The individual departments are rarely mentioned.</p><p><em>A third of those filling out the Nettskjema did not write their institutional affiliation: Why? &ndash; There seems to be confusion around what we are asking for here, and perhaps: Why we want to know their affiliation in the first place.</em></p><h3 id=what-workshop-or-topics-are-our-learners-missing>What Workshop or Topics Are Our Learners Missing?
<a class=anchor href=#what-workshop-or-topics-are-our-learners-missing>#</a></h3><ul><li><p>Summing up from the surveys, most learners are interested in learning any or more of <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>R</strong>. Most want to use it for data analysis, thus requesting focus on packages like <strong>Pandas</strong>, <strong>NumPy</strong>, <strong>SciPy</strong> etc.</p></li><li><p>They also want more targeted courses on specific kinds of data (e.g. <strong>ecology</strong>, <strong>climate</strong>, <strong>bio</strong>, <strong>archeology</strong>, <strong>spatio-temporal</strong>).</p></li><li><p>Generally, learners ask to learn more about <strong>statistics</strong> or want to do more practical statistical analysis with R or Python.</p></li><li><p>Additionally, <strong>plotting</strong> and <strong>visualization</strong> are requested.</p></li><li><p>Indepented from language, many learners asked for workshops dealing with <strong>data preparation</strong> and <strong>data cleaning</strong> - basically everything that happens before analysis.</p></li><li><p><strong>Machine learning</strong> is more and more requested.</p></li><li><p>Generally, there is a need for <strong>more workshops on advanced levels</strong>. Learners who aren&rsquo;t novices anymore don&rsquo;t seem to find workshops for their level; this might also be a reason for why our workshops often have quite advanced learners even though they are explicitely targeted towards novices &ndash; an issue that occasionally leads to overbooked workshops and dissatisfied learners and teachers.</p></li><li><p>There is also the request for workshops for <strong>specific tools</strong>, like <strong>SPSS</strong>. USIT has courses; we could consider spreading information about these at our workshops.</p></li><li><p>Summing up: Including more <strong>Data Carpentry</strong> workshops could help meet the learners&rsquo;s needs.</p></li></ul><h3 id=comments-and-constructive-criticism>Comments and Constructive Criticism
<a class=anchor href=#comments-and-constructive-criticism>#</a></h3><ul><li>Generally, our learners really appreciate that we offer workshops on a variety of topics and rate the workshops overall very positively. Our instructors are highly regarded for their enthusiasm, teaching spirit and patience and the helper-system gets univocally positive feedback.</li></ul><p><strong>Positives are: Helpers and individual assistance &ndash; enthusiastic teachers &ndash; pedagogic teaching &ndash; good atmosphere &ndash; real life examples (data, code)</strong></p><ul><li>There is a certain amount of criticism, not all of which is directed at our workshop organisation and instructores.</li><li>Generally, <strong>communication before the workshop</strong> could be improved. <strong>Prior to the workshops, <strong>clearer instructions on installation
of software</strong>, <strong>download of data sets or code bits</strong> and ** quick self-tests</strong> are recommended.</li><li>Apart from that, learners would like to get a more <strong>realistic schedule for the the workshop</strong>: will the topics mentioned in the schedule actually be taught in the workshop. <em>(Comment AR: We have experienced that we
are note able to teach the entire Python module in one day; of 10 lessons we manage 6; the course description has the entire 10 lessons, thus creating expectations we cannot meet).</em></li><li><strong>Time management</strong> and <strong>workshop logistics</strong> have been mentioned as an area of improvement, especially when it comes to <strong>breaks</strong>.</li><li>Overall, our instructors and helpers receive very positive feedback. However, <strong>live coding and navigation speed</strong> is sometimes an issue as are too short or missing explanations.</li><li>Most criticism is directed at co-learners who arrive unprepared which leads to delays and occupies helpers and instructors</li></ul><h3 id=are-we-reaching-our-goals-with-software-carpentry>Are We Reaching Our Goals With Software Carpentry?
